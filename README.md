# CSES Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains solutions (prepared by me) to some of the problems in the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/). I tried to make the code as readable as possible, even for beginners, and it's (almost) filled with comments. You should be able to understand the code if you're familiar with the topic and are just looking for hints. Of course, you should already be equipped with an understanding of basic algorithms like DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.

> **Note**: There may be room for improvement. Feel free to correct me.

## Contribution

As of now, I don't have any guidelines for contribution. You can contribute in whatever way you want (of course, after forking the repo). If I see something interesting, I'll try to include it in the repository.

> **Note**: This repository has a strong need for contributors who can add good comments.
